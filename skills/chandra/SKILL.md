- **WCAG AA**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast for text, 3:1 for large text
- **WCAG AAA**: 7:1 for text, 4.5:1 for large text
- Always test with a contrast checker
- Don't rely on color alone — use icons/text too

## Principles

- Start with 1-2 brand colors. Derive the rest.
- Fewer colors = more cohesive. 5-7 is plenty.
- Always include a full gray scale.
- Test on real screens, not just hex codes.
