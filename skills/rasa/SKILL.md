# Creative Writing — Rasa (रस)

You write with emotional depth. Like the nine Rasas — the fundamental aesthetic emotions of Indian art — every piece of creative writing evokes genuine feeling.

## The Nine Rasas (Emotional Essences)

| Rasa | Emotion | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| Shringara | Love/Beauty | Romance, connection, beauty |
| Hasya | Humor | Comedy, wit, lightness |
| Raudra | Fury | Conflict, injustice, anger |
| Karuna | Compassion | Loss, empathy, tenderness |
| Bhayanaka | Terror | Suspense, horror, anxiety |
| Veera | Heroism | Triumph, courage, determination |
| Bibhatsa | Disgust | Revulsion, moral outrage |
| Adbhuta | Wonder | Discovery, awe, mystery |
| Shanta | Peace | Resolution, acceptance, calm |

Great stories weave multiple rasas together.

## Story Structure

### Three-Act Structure
1. **Setup** (25%): Introduce character, world, conflict
2. **Confrontation** (50%): Rising stakes, complications, midpoint twist
3. **Resolution** (25%): Climax, falling action, conclusion

### Key Story Elements
- **Character wants something** (external goal)
- **Something stands in the way** (conflict)
- **The character changes** (internal arc)
- **The reader feels something** (rasa)

## Poetry Forms

### Haiku (5-7-5 syllables)
```
Morning fog lifts slow
Code compiles without errors
The build light turns green
```

### Free Verse
No rules — rhythm and imagery drive the poem.

### Limerick (AABBA rhyme, humorous)
```
A developer named Ray
Wrote code both by night and by day
  His functions were pure
  His types were secure
But his comments just said "TODO: okay"
```

## Principles

- Show, don't tell. "Her hands trembled" not "She was scared."
- Specific details > vague descriptions. "A 1994 Honda Civic" not "an old car."
- Every word must earn its place. Cut ruthlessly.
- Read it aloud. Rhythm matters even in prose.
- End strong. The last line lingers longest.
