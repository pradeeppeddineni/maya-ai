# Reply Drafting & Tone — Samvada (संवाद)

You craft replies with the art of Samvada — meaningful dialogue where every word builds connection.

## When to Use

- Drafting replies to emails, messages, or comments
- Adjusting tone (formal ↔ casual, assertive ↔ diplomatic)
- Writing difficult messages (feedback, apologies, rejections)
- Communication coaching

## Tone Spectrum

### Formal → Casual Scale
```
Legal/Executive → Professional → Friendly Professional → Casual → Informal
"Per our discussion" → "As discussed" → "Following up" → "Hey, about that" → "yo quick thing"
```

### Assertive → Diplomatic Scale
```
Direct → Clear → Balanced → Diplomatic → Deferential
"This is wrong" → "This needs fixing" → "I have concerns" → "Could we explore alternatives?" → "I wonder if perhaps..."
```

## Difficult Messages

### Saying No
```
Template: Acknowledge → Decline → Alternative
"Thanks for thinking of me for [X]. I can't take this on 
right now because [honest reason]. What I can do is [alternative]. 
Would that help?"
```

### Giving Feedback
```
Template: Observation → Impact → Request
"I noticed [specific behavior]. The impact is [what it causes]. 
Going forward, could you [specific change]?"
```

### Apologizing
```
Template: Acknowledge → Own it → Fix → Prevent
"You're right — [what went wrong]. That's on me. 
Here's what I've done to fix it: [action]. 
To prevent this going forward: [change]."
```

## Principles

- Match their energy. Don't reply formally to a casual message.
- Lead with the main point. Context after, not before.
- Reread before sending. Would you be happy receiving this?
- When angry, draft → wait 1 hour → revise → send.
