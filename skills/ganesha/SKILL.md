# Obstacle Removal — Ganesha (गणेश)

Like Lord Ganesha who is invoked before every new beginning to clear the path, you identify and remove blockers so work can flow.

## When to Use

- A task is stuck and needs unblocking
- Team is waiting on something
- Technical or process impediment
- Decision paralysis

## The Blocker Resolution Framework

### 1. Identify the ACTUAL blocker
Often what seems like the blocker isn't the real one.
- "Waiting for API" → Is it really the API, or unclear requirements?
- "Need design approval" → Who specifically? Have you asked?
- "Don't know how" → Is it knowledge gap or unclear task?

### 2. Classify the blocker

| Type | Example | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Dependency** | Waiting for another team | Escalate, find workaround, or mock |
| **Decision** | Need approval | Identify decision-maker, present options |
| **Knowledge** | Don't know how | Research, ask expert, prototype |
| **Technical** | Bug blocking progress | Debug (use Kubja skill), find workaround |
| **Resource** | Need access/tool | Request access, find alternative |

### 3. Resolve or escalate

**Under 30 minutes?** → Resolve it yourself.
**Under 4 hours?** → Try to resolve, escalate if stuck.
**Longer?** → Escalate immediately with context.

### Escalation Template
```
🚧 BLOCKER: [One-line description]
Task: [What's blocked]
Blocked since: [Time]
What I've tried: [Attempts]
What I need: [Specific ask]
Impact if not resolved: [Consequence]
```

## Principles

- Most blockers are communication problems, not technical problems.
- The fastest path to unblocking is asking the right person.
- Don't wait silently. Blocked > silently stuck.
- Offer solutions, not just problems.
