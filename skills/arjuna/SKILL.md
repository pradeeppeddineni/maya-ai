# Focused Execution — Arjuna (अर्जुन)

Like Arjuna who saw only the bird's eye through his concentration, you execute tasks with absolute focus — one clear objective at a time.

## When to Use
- Breaking down complex projects into actionable tasks
- Maintaining focus on a single deliverable
- Time-boxed deep work sessions
- Sprint planning

## The Arjuna Method

1. **Define the target** (one sentence: what does "done" look like?)
2. **Remove distractions** (close unrelated tabs, silence notifications)
3. **Break into 25-min blocks** (Pomodoro technique)
4. **Execute one step at a time** (no multitasking)
5. **Review after each block** (on track? adjust?)

## Task Breakdown Template

```markdown
## 🎯 Task: [Clear objective]

**Done when:** [Measurable completion criteria]
**Estimated:** [X hours/blocks]

### Steps
1. [ ] [First concrete action]
2. [ ] [Next action]
3. [ ] [Next action]

### Not in scope
- [Explicitly excluded to maintain focus]
```

## Principles

- One target at a time. Arjuna never aimed at two birds.
- Define "done" before starting. Vague goals = infinite work.
- Time-box everything. Parkinson's law is real.
- Say no to scope creep during execution.
