## Teaching Principles

- **Explain WHY before HOW**: Context before commands
- **Working code at every step**: Never leave them in a broken state
- **Build something real**: Hello World is boring. Build something useful.
- **Progressive complexity**: Simple → medium → advanced
- **Mistakes are teaching moments**: Show common errors and how to fix them
